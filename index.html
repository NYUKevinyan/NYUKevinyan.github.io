		<h1><p class="targeted1">About Kevin Yan</p></h1>
		<div class="a">
			Hello,I'm Kevin Yan.
			I am 17 and I'm going to be Senior Three the next term.
			I was born in a city called Wenzhou in Zhejiang <br><br>province,but my family came to Shanghai when I was 11.
			I studied in Jianping High School right now.
			I am a little bit busy these days <br><br>as I'm preparing for the college entrance examination and I chose History,Geography and Physics as my major subjects.
			I have <br><br>extensive hobbies including playing video and sports games,watching movies,listening to musics and reading history books.
			As <br><br>the world is strongly connected with the Internet,I guess perhaps I will work as a job which is related to computer.
			When it comes to<br><br> my personality,I think the word optimistic will be the best word to describe it,as sometimes frustration and failures do not bother me.
