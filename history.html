			----As far as I know about myself,Iâ€™m keen on history,no matter it is native history or foreign history.When I was no more than ten years old,I had got a brief comprehension about Chinese history,including information about dynasties and celebrities.As I grow older,I start to learn about history of the whole world by reading books.Besides,I have a deeper understanding about history.<br><br><br>
			----Through the learning of American history and culture in NYU Shanghai last week,I learnt more about the black history,the Second World War and the Cold War.Also,I recognized that we should have our own judgements when reading history books as not all words on the history book is true.<br><br><br>
			----Though I may not take jobs related to history in the future,I can regard history as an interest of mine,which will surely benefit my life.<br><br><br>
